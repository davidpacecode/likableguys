<h1>We're generally pleasant and mostly inoffensive</h1>

<p>
Likable Guys is intended to be a site containing information on a variety of topics of interest to two guys. These guys are pretty likable. 
By this I mean that they’re generally pleasant and mostly inoffensive.

Eventually, I think the site structure might look something like what’s below. 
That said, “coming soon” sections are pretty lame. So will keep pages like that to a minimum. 
Note that this is a page like that…

<ul>
<li>Home
<li>Swimming (this is coming next…)
<li>Games
<li>Tech
<li>Wellness
<li>Random
<li>About
</ul>
